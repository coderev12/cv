   <h4> I am Collage student studing in Amity University, Noida.I had take a CSE branch which I love the most.<br>
    In the starting I am preparing for many of th collages and try to find the best one out of it but I
    had not join any of the coaching.I was thinking that coaching don't do much.The only thing which matter
    is you skill and your interest in that learning,if you don't have that no any coaching institude can dare
    you to study.So this is the only mind set of mine.But maybe that don't work in my case beacuse I was very
    very passoinate about my studies but I do not get any type of proper guidence or something like that
    maybe that is the only reason I am not able to secure any of that big collage which I had dreamt earlier
    but Its ok that is not the end of my career,actually this is the first steping stone in my life.<br>Its not thatt
    being in a good collage will always get you a good career but you skills and your ability to learn and have
    passion about that.</h4>
